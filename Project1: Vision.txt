Project Vision: Soda History inventory application
The Soda Across Ages app is a single page application thatâ€™s designed for people to identify the different types of tasty beverages that have been invented since the idea first started It should guide users on a journey of understanding the many iterations and designs that soda bottles went through before arriving at their current, modern state. It should feel like a section of a museum experience and will take up the format of an inventory.
The application would allow users to identify an exhibited item's origin, design, manufacturer, description, external sources of information, and will have a list of other related items.
