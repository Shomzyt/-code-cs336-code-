Exercise 9.1

	a. Everything's in a compact file now. This significantly reduces load time. The new bundle file is 6 KB on my machine.
	b. It translated all the JSX code into Javascript so the browser doesn't have to.
	c. It can be loaded in there, since we're just giving it the the directory as the path for static files.
	d. Loads up the JSX code.

Exercise 9.2

	a. The new index.html is the same, but the new bundle.js is quite large. There are also some imports near start of the code for each module.
	b. It allows the import to take place in the actual file that needs them. In addition, it ensures that each module loads only what's necessary.
	c. It only loads the index.html and the bundle.js. The CSS file isn't loaded.

Exercise 9.3

	a. The development server seems to reload the index.html and bundle.js in real-time whenever modified, allowing us to see any changes we make. The localhost:3000 retains the original environment when the server was started.
	b. It's frustrating but it seems worth it to have it. If we want a stable build version while also developing a new one, we can do that now.
